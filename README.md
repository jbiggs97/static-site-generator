# static-site-generator

## Usage
After cloning the repo, just fill the content in "/content/" with the md files you wish to make. The HTML structure will be cloned to the "/public/" directory.

if you wish to include any images, they should go in "/static/images/", as long as the reference in the Markdown is consistent this will not be an issue though.

Update the css in "/static/index.css" if you want to further customise.

Once you are happy with the markdown, then just run `./main.sh` from the root directory.
